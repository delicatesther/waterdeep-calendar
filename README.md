# Waterdeep Calendar
This is a digital version of the Calendar of Harptos as used in the city of Waterdeep, Faerûn under an MIT licence. It includes all holidays mentioned in *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist* by [Wizards of the Coast](http://company.wizards.com/).

It was built for two reasons;
a. To aid the campaign planning of a fledgling DM (namely me),
b. To keep practising and improving FE development skills. (Having said that; feel free to join in and improve this project if you wish!)

## Getting started
*  Open up command prompt and run `cd path/to/your/WaterdeepCalendarFolder`
*  Run `npm install` to install all required modules.
*  **Run `npm start` to run a local server with a auto-reload and to watch for changes in JS and SCSS. 
*  When you want to stop a task, run `ctrl + c` to quit the current task.

## Development notes
This page is built using a combination of good-old HTML5, SCSS and jQuery. It uses NPM CLI tasks  to compile code, definitions of which can be found in package.json.
